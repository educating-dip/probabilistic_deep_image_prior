This repository is now deprecated; please use the [bayes_dip](https://github.com/educating-dip/bayes_dip/) repository instead.

The `bayes_dip` repository has been released along with version 2 of the paper [arxiv:2203.00479](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00479) "Uncertainty Estimation for Computed Tomography with a Linearised Deep Image Prior" (the title of version 1 was "A Probabilistic Deep Image Prior for Computational Tomography").

For documentary purposes, this repository is left public, so you can still access the code by selecting an old commit.
